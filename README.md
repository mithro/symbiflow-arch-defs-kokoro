# SymbiFlow Architecture Definitions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs)

This repo contains documentation of various FPGA architectures, it is currently
concentrating on;

 * Lattice iCE40
 * Artix 7

The aim is to include useful documentation (both human and machine readable) on
the primitives and routing infrastructure for these architectures. We hope this
enables growth in the open source FPGA tools space.

The repo includes;

 * Black box part definitions
 * Verilog simulations
 * Verilog To Routing architecture definitions
 * Documentation for humans

The documentation can be generated using Sphinx.

# Getting Started

Make sure git submodules are cloned:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Run the full suite:

```
make
```
